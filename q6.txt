The rtree is much faster than common index. Because when using rtree, it can ignore those nodes too far away, thus not have to search the whole table.
There is no obvious difference among the different choices of length in common index approach. Because all of them need to search the whole table.
While there is difference in runtime when choosing difference length in rtree approach. The smaller the length, the faster the query runs.
